# ⚽ Football Ticket Booking System - Database Design

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a relational database design for a **Football Ticket Booking System**.

The system manages football fans, tournament matches, and ticket booking transactions.

The main purpose of this project is to practice:

* Database design
* ERD modeling
* Primary Key & Foreign Key relationships
* Data integrity constraints
* SQL queries
* JOIN operations
* Subqueries
* Aggregation
* NULL handling
* Pagination

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* PostgreSQL
* SQL
* Beekeeper Studio
* Draw.io (ERD Design)

---

## 🗂️ Database Schema

The database contains three main tables:

### 1. Users Table

Stores all registered users including football fans and ticket managers.

Columns:

* `user_id` (Primary Key)
* `full_name`
* `email`
* `role`
* `phone_number`

---

### 2. Matches Table

Stores tournament match information and ticket availability.

Columns:

* `match_id` (Primary Key)
* `fixture`
* `tournament_category`
* `base_ticket_price`
* `match_status`

---

### 3. Bookings Table

Stores ticket purchase records and connects users with matches.

Columns:

* `booking_id` (Primary Key)
* `user_id` (Foreign Key)
* `match_id` (Foreign Key)
* `seat_number`
* `payment_status`
* `total_cost`

## 🔗 Database Relationships

### One-to-Many Relationship

One user can create multiple bookings.

```
Users 1 -------- N Bookings
```

Example:

A football fan can buy tickets for multiple matches.

---

### Many-to-One Relationship

Many bookings belong to one match.

```
Bookings N -------- 1 Matches
```

Example:

A popular match can have thousands of ticket bookings.

## 🚀 Query Concepts Practiced

| Concept         | Example                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------- |
| WHERE Filtering | Available matches          |
| LIKE / ILIKE    | User search                |
| COALESCE        | NULL handling              |
| INNER JOIN      | Booking details            |
| LEFT JOIN       | Users without booking      |
| Subquery        | Above average booking cost |
| LIMIT/OFFSET    | Pagination                 |
